# anomaly-detection-HEP

The objective of this project is to develop an unsupervised
anomaly detection framework using Variational Autoencoders to identify local
overdensities in high energy physics data, thereby distinguishing signal resonances from
the overwhelming background noise. This method aims to enhance the detection of
group anomalies..
