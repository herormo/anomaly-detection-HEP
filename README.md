# anomaly-detection-HEP


The objective of this project is to develop an unsupervised anomaly detection framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to identify potential new physics phenomena in proton-proton collision data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The dataset, which simulates real-time data streams from LHC detectors like ATLAS and CMS, has been pre-filtered to include events containing at least one electron or muon.
